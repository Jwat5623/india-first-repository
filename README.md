## Exploring GitHub
- Git is a very powerful tool used to keep code organized through version control. GitHub is an online platform that uses the git technology to allow developers to store, share, and collaborate on coding projects. Git and GitHub are a critical part of the daily workflow for all developers and development teams.
- Git is a free, open-source version control system widely used in the programming world. Git is a technology that is independent of any programming language or computer operating system.

Git was created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, to track changes in source code. Git is accessed primarily through the command line.

The history of the name "git" according to Mr. Torvolds is quite funny. "Git" is British slang for pig-headed or argumentative. This will feel very appropriate at moments when interacting with git. Mr. Torvolds says that while "git" was a random three-letter combination that is pronounceable and was not currently used by any common UNIX command, the true meaning of git can change, depending on your mood:

Global Information Tracker: if you're in a good mood, and it actually works for you. Angels sing and light suddenly fills the room.
Godd**n Idiotic Truckload of sh*t: when it breaks.
- GitHub is an online platform that uses git version control technology. GitHub allows developers to share and store code. GitHub is the largest host of code in the world (as of 2023). GitHub also offers developers tools for testing and deployment of applications. Developers create personal GitHub accounts that can be connected to teams allowing for collaboration on projects.

Git version control exists on an individual computer. GitHub is accessed online. Connecting an individual computer to GitHub requires some configurations. These configurations are outlined in another section of the syllabus.

GitHub holds the source code for applications. The source code lives in named directories called repositories or repo for short. A repository can hold many other directories and files of code that make up a project.


### Vocabulary
- git - version control, local
- GitHub - online platform that allows for code sharing, remote
- repository/repo - named folder on GitHub
- cloning - bringing a repo from the remote to the local

### Steps to Push to GitHub
- git status
    - informational command
- git add file-name
    - staging files
- git commit -m "active voice and descriptive message"
    - version control
    - computer id tracking number
    - message for our changes
- git push origin branch-name
    - right now the branch name is main
    - reconciles the diff between local and remote
